# About Project

This is my first pet project.  
It is a basic implementation of SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics).

This is a simplified version of SPH, created without spatial hashing.  
The project is still under development and may contain bugs or unoptimized code.

## Features

- Basic SPH simulation
- Particle system
- Visualization using OpenGL
